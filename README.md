# NLP-with-Disaster-Tweets
Final project of Machine Learning.

## Introduction
This peoject is to analyze disaster tweets by using natural language processing and finding out the most precise method. 

In this project, we import necessary libraries, load the dataset and split the dataset into training set and test set. Next, we select Term Frequency-Inverted Document Frequency (TF-IDF) as the feature extraction technique and build ten different classification techniques. In order to evaluate these modelsâ€™ performance, we calculate training accuracy, validation accuracy and F1-Score for all the models, and eventually find out the optimal one to predict which tweets are about the real disaster and which are not. The most important method we used in this project is Natural Language Processing so that we can quickly and efficiently process text, disambiguate, and better extract key information.
